# Start-up classification:

Business Case:
There are many start-up companies founded every year. There are a few which valuation increases rapidly, some are acquired by other companies, and decided publicly trade.

There are economic implications for any of these outcomes for the investors, employees and founders.

The Data:

I will use for this project the 2013 Snapshot data from Crunchbase ( https://www.crunchbase.com/). I applied for access to the API and I received a key to access this dataset.

I also applied to access to their current dataset for research purposes, but I have not received a determination yet.

The 2013 Snapshot contains a replica of the Crunchbase dataset from December 2013. That includes all organization, people, and product profiles along with funding rounds, acquisitions, and IPOs.

Minimum Viable Product:

The MVP for this project is to classify companies between likely to acquired and not likely to be acquired.
